### Chap. 1: Writing in science

Getting the paper published: basic requirement;

Getting the paper cited: success.

The goal of a paper is to let others know your work, communicate with others, and inspire new ideas.

Thinking clearly does not mean you can write clearly. Clear thinking can emerge from clear writing.

Most of us will have a painful process to rewrite our manuscript, including some brilliant guys.

"It is the author's job to make the reader's job easy."

Writing is not something post hoc.

### Chap. 2 Storytelling

Introduction and discussion is the part telling story.

Storytelling is not unprofessional. Because we get the story from the data, not before the data.

Listing the data or all the informations from the data is unnecessary, and we need a story from the data.

Data -> Information -> Knowledge -> Understanding

Explore the fringe of your data.
